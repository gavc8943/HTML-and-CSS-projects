	<h4>About</h4>
	<p>Born: November 27, 1942, Seattle, Washington, U.S. Though his active career as a featured artist lasted a mere four years,
	Hendrix altered the course of popular music and became one of the most <strong>successful</strong> and influential musicians of his era.
	Jimi Hendrix is considered the greatest electric guitar player of all time.
	This honor is bestowed upon him not only by fans and musicians everywhere but also by scholars and most guitar legends.
	Contrary to what one might think, technique was not his forte. Sure, Hendrix had great facility on the instrument, but his greatest strengths were his otherworldly creativity and unmatched ability to connect with an audience. </p>
