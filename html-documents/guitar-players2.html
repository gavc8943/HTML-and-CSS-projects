	<h4>About</h4>
	<p>Jimmy Page was born on January 9, 1944 in Heston, Middlesex, England, UK.
	He is a composer and actor, known for The Song Remains the Same (1976), Godzilla (1998) and The Adam Project (2022).
	He was previously married to Jimena Gomez-Paratcha, Patricia Ecker and Charlotte Martin.
	He is notable for occasionally playing his guitar with a cello bow to create a droning sound texture to the music.
	Page began his career as a studio session musician in London and,
	by the mid-1960s, alongside Big Jim Sullivan, was one of the most sought-after session guitarists in Britain.
